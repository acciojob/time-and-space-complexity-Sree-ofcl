	<h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is used to detects the executing time of code with the help of fundamental graphs and logical statistics.
	Using the graphs and fundamental logistics we can find time complexity in an efficient manner.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is used to detects the memory storage for our codes to finding the space occupation in a line or a declaration.
	For example, Let's see there is an data that are in array format with n values means the sapce complexity of array is O(n).</p>
